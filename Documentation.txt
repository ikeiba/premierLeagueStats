1.	INTRODUCTION:

2.	DATASET:
For our project, we have selected a dataset that gives precise statistics on Premier League teams for the 2023-2024 season. To build this dataset, we gathered information from about 30 different CSV files, combining them into a data frame containing lots of information. This data contains plenty of metrics as expected goals (xG), average possession percentages, total wins, away wins, and many other statistics.

Our main objective is to analyse various factors that are related and influence each other. However, these relationships are often difficult to detect by just looking at the raw data. By combining data analysis techniques, we will find patterns and correlations to get a better view of team performances, strategies, and overall success . This analysis will show how these factors affect each other as well as help us understand their impact on the league results.

3.	DATASET LOADING:
For loading all the csv we have used the methos read.csv with its default parameters, as all csv files have headers, each value is separated by “,” and decimals are indicated by “.”. Also, we don’t have any “NA” value nor quotes, so we don’t have the need of changing these parameters. 
4.	DATA CLEANING:
We haven’t had the need to clean the data, as every parameter of each football team has a defined value, so it isn’t any missing data needed to be manage, and also as there aren’t nonsense values that could be identified as outline values.
